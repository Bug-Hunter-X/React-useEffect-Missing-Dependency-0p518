This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: missing dependencies in the dependency array.  The `useEffect` hook in `bug.js` is missing the `count` variable from its dependency array, causing unexpected behavior. The corrected version in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the proper way to include the dependency, ensuring that the effect only runs when the `count` variable changes.
